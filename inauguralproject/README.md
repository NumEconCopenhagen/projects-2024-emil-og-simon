# Introduction
Within this project, we delve into the dynamics of an exchange economy involving two consumers, A and B, alongside a market featuring two goods. Over eight distinct inquiries, we analyze the utility, allocations, and pricing across various assumptions and market conditions. 

To do this, we employ Python tools and code to tackle these questions systematically. Each response is structured with an initial task introduction, followed by detailed code implementation alongside explanations, and culminates with our reflections on the obtained results specific to the question at hand.
