# Model analysis project

**Competition in an oligopolistic market**
In this project, we aim to exmine the Cournot oligopoly model. We explore this model through various analytical and numerical techniques, examining both traditional and extended versions.

Initially, we solve the Cournot model analytically, providing insights into the strategic interactions between firms in a market where each firm independently chooses its quantity of output to maximize profits.

Subsequently, we extend the model by introducing an additional firm, resulting in a oligopoly scenario with a total of 3 firms in the market. This extension allows us to analyze the implications of increased competition on market outcomes.

Furthermore, we explore another extension by incorporating dynamic marginal costs that depends on the quantity produced. This modification adds complexity to the model but offers a more realistic representation of real-world market dynamics.

By combining analytical solutions, numerical simulations, and model extensions, our project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of oligopolistic competition and the factors influencing firm behavior and market outcomes.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
