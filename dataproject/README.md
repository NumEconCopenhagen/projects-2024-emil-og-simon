# Data analysis project

Our project is titled ** DATA PROJECT: A dive into companies, startups and bankruptcies of the Danish private sector** and is about changes in the companies that make up the different industries across the period 2007-21 and the tendencies concerning startups and bankruptcies. With the project we want to investigate questions like: "are some industries mainly made up of old established companies?", "in which industries do we find a greater will to start new companies?", "what were the impacts of the financial crisis in 2008-09 on the composition of small, medium and large companies in Denmark?" 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. GF02 (*Danmarks Statistik*) 
2. DEMO4 (*Danmarks Statistik*)

Both datasets are imported using the DstApi.
All the code along with explanations are to be found in the notebook. We have only kept the py-file to keep the code handed out with the problem description in case we can use it in a later project/problemset.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
#%pip install git+
``pip install matplotlib-venn``
