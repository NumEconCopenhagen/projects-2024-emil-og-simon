    "The **idea behind** the project is to look at the composition of different companies in different industries in Denmark. We will do this over a period (2007-21) to see the effects that might be traceable to changes to the economy - for instance from the financial crisis in 2008-09. Moreover, we will look at tendencies to start new companies in different industries over the period and investigate in which industries there is a greate tendency towards startups. We will compare with the number of bankruptcies for the period across the different industries to evaluate the prospects of future startups in the the given industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the project we want to dive into **questions** like: \"are some industries mainly made up of old established companies?\", \"in which industries do we find a greater will to start new companies?\", \"what were the impacts of the financial crisis in 2008-09 on the composition of small, medium and large companies in Denmark?\" and more. \n",

    "To do this we use **two datasets** from Statistics Denmark (Statistikbanken), [GF02](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/gf02) and [DEMO4](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/demo4).

From the link above, a few important things to mention are:\n",
    "* The industries are determined based on Statistics Denmark industry code: DB07. We will primarily focus on the 10-grp. More on DB07 can be found [here](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/nomenklaturer/db07#)\n",

On the other hand, the group of no employed has seen a drop until 2015. This can suggest, that some of the founders have chosen to close their business and take a job elsewhere. However, the growing number of companies with less than 10 employed, can also suggest that some of the companies with only the founder have succeeded in growing and hireing new employees, thus raising themselves from the 'No employed' category to the 'Less than 10 employed'."

    "* There seems to have been a negative trend in the number of trade and transporting companies in general since 2007 which can suggest less activity in that industry in general or that fewer can do what previously took more companies.\n",
    "* We see a similar trend in argiculture, forestry and fishing, which, given production is the same, can suggest that 1: fewer companies can produce the same (increasing productivity) or 2: larger companies operate larger amounts of land, forrest or fishing quotas.\n",
    "* Not surprisingly we see a drop in construction companies after the financial crisis as we could expect from postponed building projects until better economic times (or increased government spending on infrastructure etc.).\n",
    "* Only 'Information and communication' and 'Arts, entertainment and other services' seems to have been unaffected by the financial crisis in 2008-09 when looking at the number of companies. For IT this could be explained by the continuous trend of the economy and industries in general becoming more technological or low costs to start a business in that industry.\n"

    "**Key takeaway:**\n",
    "* As illustrated in the figure above, the agricultural sector exhibits a survival rate below the threshold of 1, indicating a prevalence of bankruptcies exceeding the establishment of new enterprises within this domain. Furthermore, the agricultural sector demonstrates the lowest startup rate among all branches, approximately ranging between 5-6% as depicted in the figure. This phenomenon may be attributed to the formidable entry barriers characteristic of this sector. For instance, embarking on agricultural endeavors, such as pork meat farming, necessitates access to substantial financial resources, given the exorbitant costs associated with stables, machinery, livestock, land and customized equipment tailored to specific stable requirements.\n",
    "* In contrast to the agricultural sector, the \"Information and communication\" industry exhibits a survival rate surpassing the threshold of 1, suggesting a prevalence of sustainable ventures outweighing the incidence of business closures within this domain. Moreover, this sector boasts the highest startup rate among all branches, estimated at approximately 17%. This notable trend could be attributed to the relatively low entry barriers prevalent in this market segment. In many cases, initiating endeavors within the \"Information and communication\" industry merely requires minimal resources, such as a phone and a computer. Such accessibility facilitates the establishment of new ventures and fosters a dynamic entrepreneurial landscape within this sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate sector is incorporated alongside Information and Communication and Agriculture for next part of the analysis. This decision is motivated by the anticipation of substantial changes, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis, within these specific industries."

    "**Key takeaway:**\n",
    "In the analysis presented above, it is evident that the real estate and agriculture sectors were significantly impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. This outcome was anticipated, given the marked downturn in housing purchases during this period and the challenges faced by Danish farmers in acquiring the necessary capital to overcome the sector's high entry barriers, such as purchasing land, stables, and livestock. Conversely, the information and communication industry demonstrated resilience during the crisis by successfully attracting new entrants to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2015 onwards, all three sectors observed a notable influx of new market participants. This trend can be attributed to the resurgence of optimism within Danish society and the initiation of the longest economic upturn in Denmark's recent history, as previously discussed. This extended phase of economic prosperity has provided new enterprises with significant benefits, including improved access to financial resources."

    "* The agricultural sector is experiencing a consolidation trend, with a noticeable shift from numerous small entities towards fewer, larger corporations. This trend likely stems from the strategic pursuit of economies of scale, increasingly significant in this sector, thereby raising the barriers to entry even further.\n",
    "* The real estate sector witnessed a temporary decline in company numbers following the 2008 financial crisis, succeeded by a consistent upward trajectory. This recovery aligns with the prolonged economic resurgence in Danish society, the longest in recent memory, underpinning a robust housing market historically.\n",
    "* The observable growth within the Information and Communication sector is presumably linked to the widespread digital transformation across all industries, reflecting a significant shift towards digitalization."

Additionally, we intended to examine the propensity for new company formations within different industries during this timeframe.\n",
